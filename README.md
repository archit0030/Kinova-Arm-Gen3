The error message indicates an issue with either enabling GitHub Pages in your repository or misconfiguring the GitHub Actions workflow for deploying to GitHub Pages. Here's how you can fix it:

Steps to troubleshoot and resolve:
Verify if GitHub Pages is enabled:

Go to your repository on GitHub.
Navigate to the Settings tab.
Scroll down to the Pages section (found under "Code and automation" â†’ Pages).
Ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled by selecting a source (usually the main branch and the /root or /docs folder).
If GitHub Pages is not enabled, select the appropriate branch and folder, then save the configuration.
